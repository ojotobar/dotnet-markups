# üèõ **Comprehensive SQL and Relational Database Notes**

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Databases

A **database** is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

### Common Types of Databases

| Type                   | Description                                             | Example                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Relational (RDBMS)** | Stores data in tables with relationships                | SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL |
| **NoSQL**              | Stores data in documents, key-value pairs, graphs, etc. | MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra     |

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to **interact with relational databases**.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Database Objects

| Object               | Description                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Database**         | Container for all data and objects                   |
| **Table**            | Stores data in rows and columns                      |
| **Column**           | Defines the type of data (e.g., `Name VARCHAR(100)`) |
| **Row / Record**     | A single data entry                                  |
| **View**             | A saved query that acts like a virtual table         |
| **Stored Procedure** | A saved set of SQL statements (like a function)      |
| **Trigger**          | Code that runs automatically when an event occurs    |
| **Index**            | Speeds up data lookup operations                     |
| **Schema**           | Logical grouping of tables and objects               |

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE SchoolDB;
GO

USE SchoolDB;
GO
```

### Delete a Database

```sql
DROP DATABASE SchoolDB;
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Tables (with Constraints)

```sql
CREATE TABLE Classes (
    ClassId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    ClassName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    FullName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Age INT CHECK (Age > 5),
    ClassId INT,
    CONSTRAINT FK_Students_Classes FOREIGN KEY (ClassId)
        REFERENCES Classes(ClassId)
);
```

### Explanation of Constraints:

| Constraint      | Purpose                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **PRIMARY KEY** | Uniquely identifies each record  |
| **FOREIGN KEY** | Links tables together            |
| **NOT NULL**    | Field must have a value          |
| **UNIQUE**      | Ensures all values are different |
| **CHECK**       | Validates data before insertion  |
| **DEFAULT**     | Provides a default value         |

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Relationships Between Tables

| Type             | Description                                            | Example                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **One-to-One**   | One record in a table relates to one record in another | Each student has one profile           |
| **One-to-Many**  | One record relates to multiple others                  | One class has many students            |
| **Many-to-Many** | Multiple records relate to multiple others             | Students enrolled in multiple subjects |

### Many-to-Many Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE Subjects (
    SubjectId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    SubjectName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE StudentSubjects (
    StudentId INT,
    SubjectId INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentId, SubjectId),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentId) REFERENCES Students(Id),
    FOREIGN KEY (SubjectId) REFERENCES Subjects(Id)
);
```
---

## üß± **Code Explanation**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `Subjects` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Subjects (
    SubjectId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    SubjectName VARCHAR(100)
);
```

**Breakdown:**

* `SubjectId` is the **primary key** ‚Äî unique for each subject.
* `IDENTITY(1,1)` means auto-increment from 1 upwards.
* `SubjectName` holds the name of the subject (e.g., "Mathematics", "Physics").

‚úÖ Example Data:

| SubjectId | SubjectName |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1         | Mathematics |
| 2         | Physics     |
| 3         | Chemistry   |

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `StudentSubjects` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE StudentSubjects (
    StudentId INT,
    SubjectId INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentId, SubjectId),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentId) REFERENCES Students(Id),
    FOREIGN KEY (SubjectId) REFERENCES Subjects(Id)
);
```

**This table is called a *junction* or *bridge* table.**
It represents the **many-to-many** relationship between students and subjects.

**Meaning:**

* A student can take many subjects.
* A subject can have many students.

‚úÖ Example Data:

| StudentId | SubjectId |
| --------- | --------- |
| 1         | 1         |
| 1         | 2         |
| 2         | 1         |
| 3         | 3         |

This means:

* Student 1 takes Math and Physics
* Student 2 takes Math
* Student 3 takes Chemistry

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Important Details**

### üîπ Composite Primary Key

```sql
PRIMARY KEY (StudentId, SubjectId)
```

Ensures there are no duplicate pairs.
Example: You can‚Äôt accidentally insert `(1, 1)` twice.

### üîπ Foreign Keys

```sql
FOREIGN KEY (StudentId) REFERENCES Students(StudentId),
FOREIGN KEY (SubjectId) REFERENCES Subjects(SubjectId)
```

These maintain referential integrity ‚Äî you can‚Äôt add a subject enrollment for a student or subject that doesn‚Äôt exist.

---

## üßÆ **How to Insert Data**

### Add Subjects

```sql
INSERT INTO Subjects (SubjectName)
VALUES ('Mathematics'), ('Physics'), ('Chemistry');
```

### Add Student Enrollments

```sql
INSERT INTO StudentSubjects (StudentId, SubjectId)
VALUES (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 3);
```

---

## üîç **How to Query It**

### List all Students and their Subjects

```sql
SELECT s.FullName, sub.SubjectName
FROM StudentSubjects ss
JOIN Students s ON ss.StudentId = s.StudentId
JOIN Subjects sub ON ss.SubjectId = sub.SubjectId;
```

### Find All Students Taking ‚ÄúMathematics‚Äù

```sql
SELECT s.FullName
FROM StudentSubjects ss
JOIN Students s ON ss.StudentId = s.StudentId
JOIN Subjects sub ON ss.SubjectId = sub.SubjectId
WHERE sub.SubjectName = 'Mathematics';
```

---

## üí° **Bonus Teaching Tip**

If your students struggle to visualize the relationships, use this analogy:

> **Students** = People
> **Subjects** = Classes
> **StudentSubjects** = Attendance sheet showing who takes what

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Data Normalization

**Normalization** is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

| Normal Form                       | Definition                                                                           | Example                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1NF (First Normal Form)**       | Each cell holds a single value (no repeating groups)                                 | ‚ùå ‚ÄúPhones: 0801, 0812‚Äù ‚Üí ‚úÖ Split into multiple rows    |
| **2NF (Second Normal Form)**      | No partial dependency ‚Äî all non-key columns depend on the full primary key           | Avoid duplicating class names in student table         |
| **3NF (Third Normal Form)**       | No transitive dependency ‚Äî non-key columns shouldn‚Äôt depend on other non-key columns | Move `TeacherName` from `Subjects` to `Teachers` table |
| **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)** | Stricter version of 3NF ‚Äî every determinant must be a candidate key                  |                                                        |

### Example of Poor Design (Unnormalized)

| StudentId | StudentName | ClassName | Teacher  |
| --------- | ----------- | --------- | -------- |
| 1         | Ada         | SS1       | Mr. John |
| 2         | John        | SS1       | Mr. John |

üëâ Problem: Teacher name repeats unnecessarily.

### After Normalization

* `Students(StudentId, StudentName, ClassId)`
* `Classes(ClassId, ClassName, TeacherId)`
* `Teachers(TeacherId, TeacherName)`

Now each piece of data has **a single source of truth**.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Common SQL Operations (CRUD)

### Create

```sql
INSERT INTO Students (FullName, Age, ClassId)
VALUES ('Ada Obi', 16, 1);
```

### Read

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students;
```

### Update

```sql
UPDATE Students
SET Age = 17
WHERE StudentId = 1;
```

### Delete

```sql
DELETE FROM Students
WHERE StudentId = 1;
```

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Filtering and Sorting

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age > 15;
SELECT * FROM Students ORDER BY FullName ASC;
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age BETWEEN 15 AND 18;
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE FullName LIKE 'A%';
```

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregation and Grouping

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalStudents FROM Students;
SELECT ClassId, AVG(Age) AS AvgAge FROM Students GROUP BY ClassId;
```

---

## üîü Joins Explained

| Type                | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **INNER JOIN**      | Only matching rows                      |
| **LEFT JOIN**       | All rows from left, matching from right |
| **RIGHT JOIN**      | All rows from right, matching from left |
| **FULL OUTER JOIN** | All rows from both sides                |
| **CROSS JOIN**      | Cartesian product of both tables        |

Example:

```sql
SELECT s.FullName, c.ClassName
FROM Students s
JOIN Classes c ON s.ClassId = c.ClassId;
```

---

## 11Ô∏è‚É£ Indexes

Indexes make lookups faster but slow down inserts/updates slightly.

```sql
CREATE INDEX IX_Students_FullName ON Students(FullName);
```

---

## 12Ô∏è‚É£ Views

A **view** is a saved query you can reuse as a virtual table.

```sql
CREATE VIEW vw_StudentClassInfo AS
SELECT s.FullName, c.ClassName
FROM Students s
JOIN Classes c ON s.ClassId = c.ClassId;
```

---

## 13Ô∏è‚É£ Stored Procedures

Reusable SQL scripts with parameters:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetStudentsByClass
    @ClassId INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Students WHERE ClassId = @ClassId;
END;
```

Call it:

```sql
EXEC GetStudentsByClass @ClassId = 1;
```

---

## 14Ô∏è‚É£ Transactions

Used to ensure **atomicity** ‚Äî all steps succeed or all fail.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Students SET Age = 18 WHERE StudentId = 1;
DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentId = 999; -- (invalid)

ROLLBACK TRANSACTION; -- undo everything if one fails
COMMIT TRANSACTION;   -- apply if all succeed
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è **11. EF Core and Dapper Context**
* **EF Core** automates these SQL operations behind the scenes.
* **Dapper** executes the SQL you write but maps the results to C# objects.

So SQL is **the foundation** ‚Äî EF Core and Dapper are just **different ways to use it in code**.
